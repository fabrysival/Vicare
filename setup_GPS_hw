tutorial i'd like https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps-on-the-raspberry-pi (with USB interface, for modularity scope)

so plug it in a USB port && install 

gpsd gpsd-clients

WARNING: The first time you lunch gpsd with

cgps -s

all it's offline because the demon isn't started.

So the second time all works fine...

At the startup of raspbian (SO FIRST OF ALL), I setup a cgps -s fake call for start everything.
