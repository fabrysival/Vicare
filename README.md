Prototype for iot motorcycle smarter and safer

This is an old prototype for manage the fall with motorcycle or similar.

When I was young, I've thinked to a system in case of emergency and in case I falled with my motorcycle.

After a lot of time, I decide to release it free (GPL V3) for help everybody to drive safe.

Vicare it's based on a Rpi v2, a gyroscope, a GPS module and an internet key for sending one (or more) sms to notify where te tilt angle go down. So the system send a text to a mobile phone number whit latitude, logitude and speed at the moment of fall attempt.

In my mind I want to create a simple black box for every 2-wheels.

It's old and a unmanaged project. I haven't time to update it or renew it. 

It's my gift to this trouble world.
